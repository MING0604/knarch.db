/**
 * In Android, the session is part of the stack that facilitates multithreaded sqlite access. Currently, due
 * to KN's restrictive threading rules, we're serializing db access. As this code matures, we *may*
 * refactor this to approximate Android's support, but currently the session is the gatekeeper to make
 * sure all access to the underlying connection is single threaded.
 *
 * This class can be shared across threads. In doing so, you should assume it is frozen. No state
 * here or below should change, with few exceptions kept in specialized and specially designated structures,
 * outside of the normal KN memory management lifecycle.
