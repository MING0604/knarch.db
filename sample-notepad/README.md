# Basic sql sample

Basic SQLite sample app.

## A More Complete Example

If you want to see a fully architected example, with Sqldelight and other libraries, check out [DroidconKotlin](https://github.com/touchlab/DroidconKotlin).

## Build

```
./gradlew build
```

Then open the ios project under notepad/ios/calculator

## Android

If in Intellij, make sure you create an Android app run config. It's Android running basic sqlite code, so apart from the 
fact that it's multiplatform, not much else to talk about.

## NOTE ON GRADLE!!!

Until the new Multiplatform gradle plugins and dependencies are stable, you need to stick to Gradle 4.7.
